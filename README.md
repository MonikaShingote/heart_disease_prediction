# heart_disease_prediction
In this project i have used 'heart disease patient dataset' from kaggle.there are various input parameters are used and output is of binary class classification.this model is predicting whether the person is having heart disease or not.

I have performed following tasks for this project:
1] importing the libraries for data cleaning , preprocessing, feature engineering
2] importing the dataset
3] Checking correlation between columns
4] Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5] function to detect outliers
6] function to remove outliers
7] comparing dataframes before (df) and after(df1) removing outliers.
8] comparing skewness
9] Relationship between dependent and independent features
10] Graphical Analysis between dependent and independent features
11] Training Model
12] scaling data
13] Model fitting
14] Model evaluation and testing

machine learning algorithms used:
1] Logistic Regression
2] Naive Bayes
3] Support Vector Machine 
4] K-Nearest Neighbors 
5] Decision Tree 
6] Random Forest 
7] Bagging Classifier
8] Adaboost
9] GradientBoost
10] XGBoost
